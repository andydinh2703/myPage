# Why am I running?

Since leaving the Hobart Volleyball team, I wanted to find something else that actually would bring my joy and health. I embrace doing hard things, and running let me do that.

# Why Geneva Half Marathon?

I never though about running this long my entire life, but the more I run, the more I love it. I believe that life is only good when it has meaning and a goal to chase. Therefore, I committed to this challenge. I've trained for 7 weeks with weekly average 30-35 miles. I enjoyed every single run of this prep. I finished the race within 1:58:47 which was one minute off from my goal but I will come back stronger next time.

**I'm thankful for this prep for making me not only a better runner but a better person, and also for all the people have been cheering and supporting my journey.**
