# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using **mdsvex**!

# What is mdsvex?

mdsvex allows us to write blog posts in simple markdown and have them rendered as Svelte components. This means:

- Easy to write content
- Server-side rendered (great for SEO)
- Can embed Svelte components inside markdown!

## Code Example

Here's some code:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more posts about my projects and learning journey!
